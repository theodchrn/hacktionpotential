## Welcome !!!

Welcome to this hacktion potential repository. You'll find data and code to help you get started with your hackathon project.
I remain at your disposal for any questions or assistance you may need. Good luck and have fun !

## Getting started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Install `uv` project manager if you haven't already. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/).
2. Inside this directory, run the following command to install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```
3. Activation your virtual environment. Based on where you are running this (local machine, cloud instance, etc.), the command may vary. Here are some common examples:
   - For local machine (Linux/Mac):
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - For local machine (Windows):
     ```bash
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - For cloud instances, refer to the specific instructions provided by your cloud service.

4. Once all the dependencies are installed (you may have issues with GPU drivers), simply check the [notebook provided](./README.ipynb) to get started with your hackathon project.
